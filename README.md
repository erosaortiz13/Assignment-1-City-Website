# Assignment-1-City-Website
DMST 290

For this website I used a Javascript library called Jquery to add functionality to the site. Specifically, I used a Jquery plug in called "menu-highlighter" so that the user can look at the navigation menu and see which page they are currently on.

- Home Page Changes: 
	-  Removed "Beaches Shopping Luxury" and "The Sunshine State" 
	- Moved the "Information Source"  to below "Read More" and removed "..."
	- Changed the background image for better visibility and made it cover the background 
	- Put "Read More" and "Information Source" on top of each other in the bottom right 
About Pages Changes:
	- Inserted header tags and moved the nav bar inside header 
	- Added "Sunny Miami" to the nav bar 
	- Put the H2 above the div container to make a clear start to the information 
	- Changed layout to flex layout to fix alignment between two sections
	- updated the width to 100 so that the letters stretch into the div 
	- Added padding so that the pictures and paragraphs aren't touching each other 
	- Changed headings to light blue to match the nav bar 
	- Footer is also light blue so that it's matching 
Nav bar changes: 
	- "Sunny Miami" on the left and links to Home page instead of both the sun and the heading being the link 
	- Changed background color to light blue and made the is-current color pink because Miami's colors are blue and pink 
	- The rest of the nav bar is on the right which is the same as it was before 
	- The nav bar is also less thick
